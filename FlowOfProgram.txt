1) input is given as a line by line string
2) the string is passed to a liveinput parser
3) the liveinput pasrser passes the current word/prefix to the Search Func in Trie
4) The Trie searches for the word/prefix by either DFS/BFS or Frequency of the word
5) the vector of results is then passed back to the liveinput parser
6) If the word selected is written more than 3 times the word is added to the Trie
